\description{
A \emph{future} is an abstraction for a \emph{value} that may
available at some point in the future.  A future can either be
\code{unresolved} or \code{resolved}, which can be checked with
\code{isResolved()}.  As long as it is \emph{unresolved}, the value
is not available.  As soon as it is \emph{resolved}, the value is
available, which can take the form of an object of any data type
or a \link[base]{condition}.
}
\seealso{
Any function may return a Future.
One such function is \code{\link{async}()}, which asynchroneously
evaluates an R expression and returns a future, which the can be
inspected for being resolved or not and when resolved can have its
value retrieved.
An alternative approach is to use the \code{\link{\%<=\%}} infix
operator, which asynchroneously evaluates an R expression and returns
a \emph{\link[base]{promise}} to assign the value to a variable, if
requested.

Package: async
==============

Version: 0.8.0-9000 [2016-04-15]
o STANDARIZATION Now using option and environment names already defined
  by the future package, i.e. future.maxTries, future.interval, and
  R_FUTURE_MAXTRIES (used to be named async::* and R_ASYNC_*).
o STANDARIZATION: Directories for BatchJobs are now created under
  .future/<session>/ of the current directory (was .async/<session>/).
  Also, those subdirectories now use prefix 'BatchJobs_' (was 'async').
  This was done to have a common directory structure also for other
  future backends that needs to keep files on the file system.
o CLEANUP: Dropping AsyncListEnv.


Version: 0.8.0 [2016-04-14]
o batchjobs() function gained class attribute.
o Renamed BatchJobsAsyncTask to BatchJobsFuture.
o CLEANUP: Removed no-longer needed asyncBatchEvalQ() because
  BatchJobsFuture is now self sufficient.
o BUG FIX: Global variables with the same name as objects in the
  base or the BatchJobs package would be overridden by the
  latter, e.g. a global variable 'col' would be masked by
  'base::col'. (Issue #55)


Version: 0.7.1 [2016-01-04]
o BUG FIX: New BatchJobs work directories would encode 08:03 as
  ' 803' instead of '0803' resulting in a BatchJobs assertion
  error on invalid pathnames.


Version: 0.7.0 [2016-01-02]
o Now value() for BatchJobsAsyncTask removes associated BatchJobs
  subdirectories upon success.  Previously, such cleanup was only
  happening when the object was garbage collected.
o Each R session that load the async package now uses a unique
  subdirectory under .async/, e.g. .async/20160102_154202-IVBRy1/.
  It is in turn under that session-specific subdirectory that the
  individual BatchJobs subdirectories corresponding to a specific
  future lives.  Note that, although, the each of latter is removed
  when calling value() for its future, the session-specific async
  directory is not removed.  In order to remove the latter, make
  sure to resolve all futures.  Then call unloadNamespace("async"),
  which will try to remove the directory.


Version: 0.6.2 [2015-11-21]
o BUG FIX: asyncBatchEvalQ() would not export globals that belongs
  to a package but are not exported.


Version: 0.6.1 [2015-10-20]
o CLEANUP: Package no longer attaches listenv.
o BUG FIX: Globals that were copies of package objects
  were not exported to the future environments.


Version: 0.6.0 [2015-10-05]
o batchjobs(sum(x, ...), globals=TRUE) now handles `...` properly.
o ROBUSTNESS: asyncBatchEvalQ() gives an informative error when
  a global variables starting with a period needs to be exported;
  these are currently not supported due to limitations in the
  BatchJobs package.
o WORKAROUND: Global variables with names starting with a period
  ort that does not match pattern '[a-zA-Z0-9._-]+' could not be
  exported due to BatchJobs limitation.  Until resolved by BatchJobs,
  this package encode and decode such variable names automatically.
o ROBUSTNESS: Package test coverage is 88%.
o BUG FIX: resolved() for AsyncFuture:s would always give FALSE
  unless value() of the future has been called first.


Version: 0.5.2 [2015-07-30]
o CLEANUP: Dropped %backend% - use %plan% backend(...) instead.
o BUG FIX: batchjobs(..., backend="interactive") changed
  also the default backend.


Version: 0.5.1 [2015-07-29]
o Adjusted to future (>= 0.7.0).
o CLEANUP: Dropped functions and tests that are now in the
  future package.


Version: 0.5.0 [2015-06-19]
o Adjusted to future (>= 0.5.1).


Version: 0.4.2 [2015-06-14]
o Added demo("mandelbrot", package="async").
o Added run() for BatchJobsAsyncTask.
o CLEANUP: BatchJobsAsyncTask no longer registers/submits jobs.
o CLEANUP: Dropped asyncEvalQ().
o CLEANUP: Dropped async() - now batchjobs().
o CLEANUP: Dropped makeClusterFunctionsRscript().
o CLEANUP: Dropped delayed assignment %<-% infix operator.


Version: 0.4.1 [2015-06-14]
o Add batchjobs() allowing for plan(batchjobs, backend="multicore").
o BatchJobsAsyncTask() and internal tempRegistry() gained
  argument 'backend'.


Version: 0.4.0 [2015-06-08]
o CLEANUP: Extract Future API and moved to new package 'future'.
o Now delayedAsyncAssign() returns a Future.
o BUG FIX: The existance of .BatchJobs.R would override
  whatever backend was already set by backend().
o BUG FIX: Asynchroneous evaluation of { a <<- 1 } no longer
  identifies 'a' as a global variable that needs to be exported.


Version: 0.3.1 [2015-05-23]
o CLEANUP: Moved more internal code to the 'listenv' package.


Version: 0.3.0 [2015-05-21]
o Now inspect(envir=x) returns all tasks if only the environment
  is specified, e.g. inspect(envir=x) vs inspect(x$a).
o Added completed() and failed(), expired().
o Any flavor of backend("multicore") is based on availableCores().
o Added availableCores() for identifying the number of available cores.
  The default is to acknowledged the assigned number of cores by
  queing systems such as Torque/PBS, before using detectCores() of
  the 'parallel' package.
o CLEANUP: Moved identification of globals to new 'globals' package.
o CLEANUP: Moved list environments to new 'listenv' package.
o ROBUSTNESS: Asynchroneous tasks that still run when R exists
  will not be stopped and not deleted.  This will allow the tasks
  running on job clusters to complete.
o BUG FIX: AsyncTask objects were not assigned to the listenv.


Version: 0.2.0 [2015-05-11]
o Functions AsyncTask() and delayedAsyncAssign() gained argument
  'substitute' for controlling whether the expression/value
  should  be substitute():d or not.
o ROBUSTNESS: Added package tests for delayedAsyncAssign().
o ROBUSTNESS: Package test coverage is 77%.
o CLEANUP: Internal restructuring with more informative classes.


Version: 0.1.4 [2015-05-02]
o Added print() for listenv:s.
o CLEANUP: Using tempvar() of R.utils.


Version: 0.1.3 [2015-04-26]
o Added AsyncListEnv.
o ROBUSTNESS: Add protection for trying to evaluating asynchroneous
  expressions with global objects that are "too large" and therefore
  introduces lots of overhead in exporting to, and importing from
  workers.  The size limit of the maximum allowed total export size
  is controlled by option 'async::maxSizeOfGlobals'.


Version: 0.1.2 [2015-04-21]
o Now status(), finished() etc. for AsyncTask returns NA in case
  task backend registry is deleted.  print() does a better job
  too in this case.
o Now inspect() also accepts complex input such as inspect(a$x),
  inspect(a[["x"]]) and inspect(a[[1]]).  It also accepts a
  character name such as inspect("x", envir=a).
o Now await() for AsyncTask gives an more informative error message
  in case the backend registry was preemptively deleted.
o Added error classes AsyncError and AsyncTaskError with more
  informative error messages simplifying troubleshooting.
o CLEANUP: Now async BatchJobs registries are created in ./.async/
o BUG FIX: Delayed (synchroneous and asynchroneous) assignments to
  listenv:s did not update the internal name-to-variable map, which
  effectively made such listenv:s object empty (although the assign
  value was stored internally).


Version: 0.1.1 [2015-04-07]
o BUG FIX: asyncBatchEvalQ() would given "Error in packageVersion(pkg) :
  package 'R_GlobalEnv'" if the expression had a global function defined
  in the global environment.  Now asyncBatchEvalQ() does a better jobs
  in identifying package names.  Added package tests for this case.


Version: 0.1.0 [2015-02-07]
o First prototype of an old idea of asynchronous evaluations with
  delayed assignments.
o Created.
